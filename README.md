# Grab-AI-challenge
Car image classification category for Grab AI challenge

My proposed model achieve more than 95% accuracy on train data, and 66% accuracy on test data.

I wrote this code with Python v3.6, Tensorflow v1.10 and Keras v2.24, Windows 10

Hardware :

1) Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8750H CPU @ 2.20GHz
2) 32 GB RAM
3) Nvidia gtx1060 8GB VRAM
4) 250GB SSD NVMe

This code also developedd under Jupyter Notebook environment.

All trained models are in saved_models folder.
